            <p>Sean Wayne Sebastian, age 34 of Morgantown, KY passed away at his residence on the 15th day of March 2023. Sean was born on Monday, the 19th day of December 1988 in Leitchfield, KY. He was the son of Leslie and Dirk Adkins of Morgantown, KY.



              Sean is survived by his parents Leslie and Dirk Adkins; two children Sean and Sadie Sebastian; three brothers Chris Sebastian (Miranda), Wyatt and Ayden Adkins; one sister Kayley McMullan (Jordan); grandmother Kathy Twitty; grandfathers Elton Adkins and Ronnie Baxter and several aunts, uncles and cousins. He is preceded in death by his aunt Ashley Phelps and grandmother Janice Adkins.
              
              
              
              Sean served in the United States Marine Corps starting in 2011. He was a lover of all things nerdy- collecting pokemon cards, having lightsaber battles, and playing video games all day and night. He was saved and baptized at Barnett's Lick Baptist Church. He loved God and spoke about Him often. He loved  singing in the shower, traveling to new destinations, hanging out with his little brothers and sister, and spending time with his parents and grandmother. His children, Sean and Sadie, were his whole world. He loved to spoil them any chance he could get and he loved them more than anything.
              
              
              
              We love you so much Sean, We can't wait to see you again and give you the biggest hug. Give Ashley lots of hugs for us.
